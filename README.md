Under_Foundation.
=================

The beautiful offspring of _S and Foundation 4. This is a WordPress starter theme for Developers.


The Mission. If You Choose To Accept It
---------------------------------------

This is a WordPress Developer's Starter Theme. This is built for users to have an excellent starting point that meets all the needs of a WordPress theme but also the flexibility and awesomeness of a grid system, predefined styles and other cool framework stuff.

This theme brings the all the key points and source code that is expected in a WordPress theme by using _S (http://underscores.me/) and then offering powerful rapid protyping capabilities and flexible grid systems found in Foundation 4 (http://foundation.zurb.com/).

Updates and the Future
----------------------
I plan to make plugins that will help extend the functionality of this theme specifically in the future and keeping this theme as minimal.

Feel free to tweak and contribute as you see fit. I'll be updating it also when Underscores or Foundation is updated.
